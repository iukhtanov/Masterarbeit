The main MATLAB programs are

plot_abbildung_3.m
and
plot_abbildung_4.m

that will generate the diagrams of the paper. All other program are necessary MATLAB functions.

The programs where developed and tested with MATLAB 7.1, but should be upward compatible to newer versions of MATLAB.

The programs are quite well commented, nevertheless most comments are in German.
